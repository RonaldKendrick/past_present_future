<h1><b>My Past,Present, and Future</b></h1>

<h2><b>My Past</b></h2>

<p>I was born in South Carolina, but at around 6 months old, my parents flew me to China.
During my stay in China, I lived in the city of Fuzhou. It is located on the northeast coast of the Fujian Province.
I grew up speaking mandarin and still know how to speak a decent amount. When I was old enough for elementary school,
I was flown back to America and attended Oakview Elementary.
From there on, I went to Beck Academy and later on <a href="https://www.greenville.k12.sc.us/jlmann/">JL Mann</a>.</p>

<p>Currently, I am attending JL Mann academy in South Carolina. I live with my family, which consists of:
my dad, mom, grandmother, brother, cousin, and me. My current job is also working for my parents restaurant,
as does my brother and cousin.</p>
<p>My interest right now is trying to get a high score (1400+) on the SAT or ACT. Because of that, I'm currently
  studying for the SAT and asking some of my friends to help and tutor me.
   My dream college is <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/">New York University(NYU)</a>, which is quite hard to
  get accepted.</p>

<h2><b>My Future</b></h2>

<p>After high school, I'm thinking of applying to NYU and a few other colleges. I would go live on campus and probably
take up a job as some sort of chef or waiter for a bit of extra cash. During college, I would be taking courses
and classes in the <a href="http://www.stern.nyu.edu/programs-admissions">Stern business school</a>. After getting out of college, I would
love to get a 6 figure job, probably as some sort of marketing manager. </p>
